![Preview-Screens](https://github.com/steniowagner/bon-appetit-app/blob/master/images/default.png)

If you want to take a look on all screens of the App, they are [here](https://github.com/steniowagner/bon-appetit-app/tree/master/images).

## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"Show differents options of restaurants, dishes and gastronomic events in the city based on what the user is looking to eat and his location in the city."_

**PS:** There's a big market behind this context, and that can be extended to other areas (like music, parties, etc), and I'll be so glad if you could find any idea based on this project to build your own business!

## Some Observations about this App

1 - All the data abount dishes, gastronomic events and restaurants that is showed in the App are mocked by me, and they don't exists in the real world. The files that contains all data that it's displayed in the App are stored on the [back-end of the app](https://github.com/steniowagner/bon-appetit-server/tree/master/src/json-models).

2 - The current-user-location that is showed by the App is also mocked. All the locations are static and provided by the [back-end of the app](https://github.com/steniowagner/bon-appetit-server) in [this file](https://github.com/steniowagner/bon-appetit-server/blob/master/src/utils/get-user-location.js).

3 - If you're running the App in an Android device (physical or virtual), you'll need to have an Google Maps key to see the Map in _Near Me_ screen and in _Restaurant Address_ Screen. To active your key, follow [this tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup). Those Screens will works properly on iOS by default.

4 - There's no functionality of Login/Register, the buttons and the forms in the Login Screen are only for UI matters.

5 - The Screen _Settings_ it's also only for UI matters.
